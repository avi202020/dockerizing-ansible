Running ansible on docker.
You may ask why? Well, many reasons, first of all pure curiosity on how to do it, second, 
you may end up in environment where you don't have ansible installed nor you have a 
permissions to install anything, but free to pull docker images, a sort of immutable infrastructure.

You will also learn how to dockerize an existing tool, and plus have a chance to play with ansible and ansible-playbook.
